# Shadowverse Wishlist

This is a wishlist application for the card-game Shadowverse. Signup for an account and browse through all the cards
available in the game. Cards are split up by classes. Click a class and see the card-set for that particular class. 
If you would like to add a card to your wishlist, simply mouse over the card you want and hit the add button. You 
can add a card as a high priority card, or a low priority card. After adding the card you can check your wishlist!
All of your added cards will be displayed, split by high and low priority. Card priorities can also be swapped or 
dropped(deleted) from your list. 

Deployed application: https://warm-hamlet-29500.herokuapp.com/
